O: Today, I learned how to connect a React front-end application with a Spring Boot back-end. We focused on setting up RESTful APIs in Spring Boot and making HTTP requests from React using Axios. This included configuring CORS to allow communication between the two applications.

R: The hands-on practice was enlightening; implementing API calls in React to fetch data from the Spring Boot server allowed me to see how these technologies interact in a full-stack application. I felt a sense of accomplishment as I successfully integrated the two, enhancing my understanding of web development.

I: Connecting React with Spring Boot significantly streamlines the development process by enabling seamless data flow between the client and server. This integration reinforces best practices in API design and promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the application more modular and maintainable.

D: Moving forward, I plan to apply this knowledge in future projects by building more complex applications that utilize React and Spring Boot together. Additionally, I will explore further optimizations for API interactions and share insights with peers to foster collaborative learning and improvement.
